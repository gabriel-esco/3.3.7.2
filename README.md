# MLH Fellow Portfolio Builder
Portfolio builder that can be used by subsequent MLH fellows to enhance their profiles.
 
## What it does
The website can be used by students, professionals to create their portfolio real quick. It can be used to boost their profile and present their skills in a very interactive way to the recruiters. 

## How we built it
We created different pages like 
- homepage has a short bio of the person.
- about page which describes the person's profile in detail.
- contacts page which can be used to directly contact the person via email. 
- we also added some hyperlinks like LinkedIn, Github.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced issues in the design part of the project as we mostly jumped to the technical part quickly. We had troubles doing the CSS part and felt the lack of time to host it on a. domain

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of us learning new technologies like CSS, HTML, Python, and Flask in a span of 2 days. 
Coming out of comfort zones and collaborating in different time zones, we learned to work in a team and always support each other.

## What we learned
The first week was intense and we loved the implementation-oriented approach. We learned many technologies ranging from CSS, HTML, Python, Flask. We loved collaborating and debugging each other's code.

## What's next for MLH Fellow Portfolio Builder
The website could be made more dynamic with users giving inputs and set up their profiles as we do in LinkedIn, and the portfolio would be ready.
